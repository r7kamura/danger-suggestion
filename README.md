A [Danger](https://github.com/danger/danger) plug-in to suggest code changes through inline comments in pull requests.

Suggestions are calculated based on the results of `git diff`, so any code formatter that performs in-place edits (rubocop, prettier, go fmt, etc.) can be used for this.
Note that there is a limitation that multi-line replacements cannot be suggested because GitHub's suggested changesâ„¢ doesn't support it.
